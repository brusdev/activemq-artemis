NOTE: Automatic queue creation is for queues that _would not otherwise be created during normal operation_.
For example, when a remote application creates a consumer on a JMS topic then a queue will be created representing that subscription as described in the xref:jms-core-mapping.adoc[JMS-to-core mapping chapter].
This queue will be created regardless of how `auto-create-queues` is configured because it is required for _normal operation_.
